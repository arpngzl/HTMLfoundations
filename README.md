<h1>Introduction to HTML and CSS</h1>
<p>HTML structures the content of a webpage, creating elements like text, links, and buttons, while CSS styles these elements by adding color, positioning, and fonts. Though often called programming languages, HTML and CSS are not, as they donâ€™t handle logic like JavaScript, which is used to make webpages interactive. Together, HTML and CSS form the essential foundation for web development.</p>
